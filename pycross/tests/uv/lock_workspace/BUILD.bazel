"""
Test that uv workspace members with editable dependencies at arbitrary paths
are correctly detected as local packages and elided from the output.

This test covers:
- `source = { editable = "./packages/lib-a" }` (workspace member)
- `source = { editable = "./packages/lib-b" }` (workspace member)
- `source = { virtual = "." }` (root virtual package)
