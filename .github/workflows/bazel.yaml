# Reusable workflow that can be referenced by repositories in their .github/workflows/ci.yaml.
# See example usage in https://github.com/bazel-contrib/rules-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/ci.yaml
#
# This assumes the repo calling the workflow has at least these files:
# - .github/workflows/ci.bazelrc
# - .bazelrc
#
# This workflow uses https://github.com/bazel-contrib/setup-bazel to prepare the cache folders.
# Caching may be disabled by setting `mount_bazel_caches` to false.

          The version from .bazelversion is used unless this option is set.

          By default, we don't test non-linux with Bazel 8 to minimize macOS and Windows minutes
          since they are billed at 10X and 2X respectively:
          https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#included-storage-and-minutes

          Note: independent of this setting, we don't create MacOS/Windows matrix entries for pull requests
          unless they come from a specially-named branch. See logic below.
