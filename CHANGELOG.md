# `rules_pycross` Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Adds `install_exclude_globs` to exclude certain files during installation of wheels.

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Introduce `package_annotation` which replaces `always_build_packages`, `build_target_overrides`,
  `package_build_dependencies` and `package_ignore_dependencies`.

## [0.5.3]

### Fixed

- Using `local_wheels` in `pycross_lock_repo` or the `lock_import` extension resulted in an invalid `select`
  statement being generated.
- Auto toolchain creation compatibility with rules_python 0.30+.
- Fix `pycross` package imports when using `--experimental_python_import_all_repositories`.

### Changed

- Rely on `cfg = 'exec'` when registering toolchains to limit the combinatorial explosion of
  len(python versions) _ len(target platforms) _ len(exec platforms). With this change, we register
  only len(python versions) toolchains.

## [0.5.2]

### Added

- Adds `requirements.bzl` to `lock_repo` with the standard `requirement` function and
  `all_requirements` list.

### Fixed

- Fixed a toolchain resolution issue if the default version toolchain came before the requested toolchain in
  lexicographical order. E.g., if 3.12.0 was the default, and 3.9.18 was requested, the matched toolchain would
  be 3.12.0.
- Fixed an issue where toolchain resolution would fail if the default python version was configured as X.Y
  instead of X.Y.Z

### Changed

- Set default GLIBC version to `2.28`, using [pep600_compliance]
  (https://github.com/mayeut/pep600_compliance#acceptable-distros-to-build-wheels) as a guide.

## [0.5.1]

### Fixed

- Fixed regressions in some examples.
- Bumped `repairwheel` version to fix wheel builds when targeting linux_aarch64.

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- (pycross_lock_file) `disallow_builds` - fail if any `pycross_wheel_build` targets would be generated.
- (pycross_lock_file) `generate_file_map` - generates a `FILES` constant that contains referenced whl
  and sdist files.
- Adds bzlmod support: see extensions under [pycross/extensions](pycross/extensions/).
- Adds a `pycross_lock_repo` WORKSPACE rule. See [example](examples/lock_repo/).

### Changed

- Self-host dependencies; no more `pip_install` dependency.
- PDM translator no longer depends on PDM itself (which was pulling in a bunch of third-party dependencies).
- `PycrossTargetEnvironmentInfo` is removed; environment JSON files are read directly.
- **BREAKING** The original `pycross_lock_repo` is renamed to `pycross_lock_file_repo`.
- `bzl_lock_generator` is split into two components: `raw_lock_resolver` and `resolved_lock_renderer`.
- **BREAKING** (pycross_poetry_lock_model) `poetry_lock_file` and `poetry_project_file` are renamed to `lock_file` and
  `project_file`, mirroring the PDM translator.
- **BREAKING** package names in lock files use Python's own normalization semantics and are no longer undercased.
  For example, `SQLAlchemy-Utils` becomes `:sqlalchemy-utils`, not `:sqlalchemy_utils`.
- **BREAKING** (pycross_lock_file) most of the `*_prefix` (`package_prefix`, `build_prefix`, etc.) are removed.
- WORKSPACE-specific rules are moved from `pycross/defs.bzl` to `pycross/workspace.bzl`.

### Fixed

- Default `pycross_target_platform` abi to `"none"` and platform to `"any"` when not specified, instead of using
  host values.
- Generated lock files satisfy Buildifier.
